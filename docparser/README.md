## Documentation generator

The documentation layout was strongly inspired in the [Multidmedia](https://www.multidmedia.com/support/livedocs/zinc/4.0/)'s layout. However, the entire mechanism of parsing the java-docs style of comments, as well as the generation of documentation pages and layout were developed by [Caio Benatti Moretti](http://www.moretticb.com).

For Linux, run **generateDocs.sh**. For Windows, run **generateDocs.bat**. Such scripts will parse and generate the documentation material and place it in *../docs* folder. It is required that PHP 5.x.x is installed in order to properly generate the documentation. In addition, it is encouraged (specially for windows users) to edit the script file in order to correctly specify the php interpreter executable file directory.
